## 🔥 The Problem: Corporate Burnout is Real

Working at corporate and feeling burnout isn't just a buzzword—it's a silent epidemic. You know the drill: endless meetings that could've been emails, deadlines that keep moving, the constant ping of notifications, and that nagging feeling that you're always behind. The 9-to-5 has become 24/7, and your mental health is paying the price.

**The statistics are sobering:**
- 76% of employees experience burnout at some point
- Burnout costs companies $190 billion annually in healthcare spending
- 50% of employees have left a job due to mental health reasons
- Only 1 in 3 employees feel their company genuinely cares about their wellbeing

The corporate world has normalized stress, but we're here to say: **enough is enough.**

## 🙏 Our Mission

MentalMadness was born from frustration—the frustration of watching brilliant people burn out, of seeing companies prioritize profits over people, of feeling like mental health is a luxury instead of a right.

We're not here to add another wellness app to the market. We're here to **change the conversation** about mental health in the workplace. We're here to give employees their power back and give companies the tools to actually care.

**Because burnout isn't a badge of honor. It's a cry for help.**

And we're listening.
